Over the past 7 or so months I have become obsessed with home automation. This started out simple enough with a few smart bulbs and a motion sensor. Those two little additions to my home led me down a path to automating absolutely anything that could be (as well as things that couldn't or even shouldn't be).

I found the open source home automation platform Home Assistant and while overwhelmed at first, fell in love. I was soon writing simple YAML and scripts to achieve what I was looking for, but I wanted more. This lead me to take on the monumental task of teaching myself how to code.

Fast forward 7 months and I have already created a few popular projects written in Python and JavaScript for the Home Assistant community. This, clearly, needed to be much more than a hobby.

After a good bit of research I signed up for Flatiron's Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. I've already learned so much and was able to implement what I have learned in my projects already. Looking forward to what comes next.
