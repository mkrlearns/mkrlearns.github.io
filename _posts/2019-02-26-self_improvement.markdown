Over the past year or so I have become obsessed with home automation. This started out simple enough with a few smart bulbs and a motion sensor. Those small additions to my home led me down a path to automating absolutely anything that could be (as well as some things that shouldn't be).

I found the open source home automation platform Home Assistant and while overwhelmed at first, fell in love. I was soon writing simple YAML and scripts to achieve what I was looking for, but I wanted more. This led me to take on the monumental task of teaching myself how to code.

Fast forward about a year and I have created a few projects written in Python and JavaScript that are popular within Home Assistant community. This, clearly, needed to be much more than a hobby. So, I recently signed up for Flatiron's Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. I've already learned so much and was able to implement what I have learned in my existing projects. Looking forward to what comes next.
